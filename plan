### 2. **Node.js Basics: Simple REST API** (3 days)

This plan will guide you through building a simple REST API using Node.js and Express.js. The objective is to help you understand the fundamentals of creating and managing APIs. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for each day.

#### **Day 1: Set Up Node.js Project**

**Objective**: Prepare the project environment and create a basic server with initial routes.

**Tasks**:

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**:
   - Ensure Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system.
   - Verify installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

2. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Create a new project directory.
   - Navigate into the directory and run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.

3. **Install Express.js**:
   - Run `npm install express` to install Express.js.

4. **Create Basic Server**:
   - Create a new file, `index.js`.
   - Set up a basic Express server in `index.js`:
     - Import Express.
     - Initialize the app.
     - Define a port.
     - Set up a basic route (e.g., GET `/`).
     - Start the server to listen on the defined port.

5. **Test the Server**:
   - Run the server using `node index.js`.
   - Open a browser or use a tool like Postman to test the basic route (`http://localhost:3000`).

#### **Day 2: Implement CRUD Operations**

**Objective**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a sample resource (e.g., users).

**Tasks**:

1. **Define the Resource**:
   - Decide on a sample resource to manage (e.g., users).
   - Create a mock data array to represent the resource.

2. **Create Routes**:
   - Set up Express routes for CRUD operations:
     - **Create**: POST `/users` - Add a new user.
     - **Read**: GET `/users` - Retrieve all users.
     - **Read**: GET `/users/:id` - Retrieve a single user by ID.
     - **Update**: PUT `/users/:id` - Update a user by ID.
     - **Delete**: DELETE `/users/:id` - Delete a user by ID.

3. **Handle Data**:
   - Use the mock data array to store and manipulate resource data.
   - Implement logic in each route to handle the corresponding operation.

4. **Test Routes**:
   - Use Postman or another API testing tool to send requests to each route.
   - Verify that each CRUD operation behaves as expected.

#### **Day 3: Test API Endpoints, Handle Errors, Refactor and Optimize Code**

**Objective**: Ensure the API works correctly, handle errors, and clean up the code for better maintainability and performance.

**Tasks**:

1. **Test API Endpoints**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of each endpoint.
   - Check for edge cases and unexpected inputs.

2. **Handle Errors**:
   - Add error handling middleware in Express to manage unexpected errors.
   - Implement validation for inputs and provide meaningful error messages.
   - Ensure the API responds with appropriate HTTP status codes.

3. **Refactor Code**:
   - Organize routes and middleware into separate files for better structure.
   - Use Express Router to manage routes modularly.
   - Clean up any redundant code and add comments for clarity.

4. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Ensure the server is performant and capable of handling multiple requests efficiently.
   - Consider adding logging to monitor API usage and performance.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the API endpoints, including the request methods, parameters, and expected responses.
   - Create a simple README file explaining how to set up and run the project.

### Summary

By the end of this 3-day plan, you will have a basic yet functional REST API built with Node.js and Express.js, covering the essential aspects of setting up a server, creating and managing routes, handling CRUD operations, and ensuring code quality and performance. This foundation will be crucial as you delve deeper into more advanced backend development concepts.
